hora the lact that the second ninety sections fill exactly eight leaves lt
rut be observed that this ialerence assumes that the first ninety
sections occupy the same amount oi room as the second. which is not
the case. Taking Kayser’s text, 1 find that the number ol lines os

mering that the transcribet tett the itrst leat blank aad began on the

point which suggests a different conclusion. 'l'he lollowing table shews
