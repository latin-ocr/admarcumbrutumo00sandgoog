lt was not until the year 355 that he wrote, in the speech agai
Androtion, hia first public oration. Thia, however. 'aa lot delict
by another; and the earliest public rpeeeher in which hc appear
in person, that on tho Symmoriea, and that directed ῳίοοι the law

his lawauits with hir guardianr, hart been devoted rothe most pair
taking preparation sor hie future career. ettennon, in hia old age,

told a younger orator, Demetrius ol Phaleron, the story which einr
and Plutarch have marle familiar, horr he had nmrered the delecte
an indistinct and lisping pronunciatiou by rcciting long pumagea rri
pebblca in bis mouth, and horr he had diaciplitted hia voice by dedat
ing while he rrae out ol breath, either trith running, or with wntktng up
steep ascent'. lt rma thur, wc are told, that he acquircd meh oorumar
over his voicc as to be capable os twice raiaing eud twice lorrcring
within the compaaa ol a single period '. In Cicem'a time, the travell
lrorn Rome might go down to the bcach ol the longdeaerted harbour
Phaleron and viere thc spot, where, as thc story ran, the orator reas rto
to declaim to tho roar ol the waves, so as to win the power ol drownir
with his voice the uproar ol the pcople⁴. Τ ο one ol the best actore

oratory, but the second also, and not the second alone, but even tl
third besides‘. In those years ol preparation, his natural delecta wer
thus slowly overcome, and his marvellous powers gradually brought t

their final perlection. Great as his gista as an orator undoubtedly rren
they were studiously improved by an indomitablc‚‚industry,—by th
burning ol that midnight oil which, as remarked by one ol hia cor
temporarics, made his speeches ‘smcll oi the lamp’⁸; by that worlt belot
