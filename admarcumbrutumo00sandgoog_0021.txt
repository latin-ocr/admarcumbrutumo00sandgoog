ne present edition, which happens to be the first that has been

pablished with an English commenlary,is lhe result ol s long delayed
udorour to repair a neglect which has been little deserued. In the

ιιιιιιιιιι or' last year when my commentary nas already in type, the
ιαιιιιΙ critieism οι’ the orator, which had remained compmuvely
duum since tlte publicetion ol Kayser's text in 1860, received an
inportant impulse hythe publication ol a new recension by Heerdegen.
'lire appearance ol this work led to my recasting and renriting my
cr'eical notes, disenmmben’ng them ol many useless readings recorded
hy tbe earlier editors, rrlule retaining the more ualuable emendations

· remed by recent scholare Βιιι it did not discourage me from carry·

ing out my resolve ιο examine sor mysell our oldest manuscript, now in

, tbepubliclibraryathvranchcs. Accordingly, my critical notes include
f the results οἰ a lresh examination os that ms, while they also record

the readings ol three early transcripts ol the lost sis ol Lodi, as
mnned by Heerdegen The general accurncy ol that collation has
hoen publicly aclrnotrledgcd bya scholar who has recently been tra·
rersing the same ground. 1 refer ιο Dr Stangl, who has kindly allowed
ue ιο see the proolsheets ol his own recension ol the text, and has
repntedly ansnered my enquiries as to the readings ol those ol the
uss which he has himself collaterl. However great may have been the
debe, which (as already remarked) was due long ago ιο German printers
settled on Italian soil, it is more than equalled by what the Oralor owes
at tlse presenrt day to the learning and patience ol German scholars
taking in Italian librales-to Dr Heerdegen ol Erlangen and Dr
Snngl ol tvunburg, whose interest in their investigatione, was, il 1
msere ool, first inspired by the odmlrable pnper on the mediaeval
borio α’ northern ltaly, contributed by Dr Detlelsen ol Glliclrstadt
ιο the philologicel congress held in 1869 at Kiel, near the northern
heiu α’ Germany.
