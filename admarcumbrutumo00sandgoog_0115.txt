uiro the lost damari. Again, we have manuscript evidence os the
sane century iu the case ol Nonius, rrho relers toll ao, ar, ις, 28, 38,

the Amori, in that ol Quintilian ; and ol the trrellth in that ol
Julius Victor, wlco gives us excerpts from §l 57, 69-μ, 76-69, 97 and
¹3²¹· Such evidence, however, though occasionally valuable, must be
ud viu the greatest care and discrimination
Among editors ot' the text there has been considerable diti'erence ol
opinion as to the relative value ol the mlier nutrit· aa compared with
the ιἰιῳί While the earliest editors (¹4⁶9-1511) adhered almost
udusirely ιο the αὕτη integri, those ol the next age (rsit-1550)
boeroved cautiously lrom the muttit· in passages, where they supplied a
better ιαιιιιοιο particularly as regards the order os the words⁸. ln the
latter hall ol the sixtcerrth century, the hest edition was that os lambi-
ιιι (15⁶⁶), which, hovetunam to some extent marrcd hy ιιι including
intupolations derived from an unsauslactcry specimen ol acodea mutilus
koovrr as the codar retur Caroli &miani (cod. Parisinus 7750, copied
an ιω) Ιιι the last quaner cl the eighteenth century, appeared the
editim οι Ernesti (1777), in which some use was made ol the codex
masagam. ln the present century, Orelli's first edition ol the whole
ol Cicero (182⁶) was succeeded by a separate reconsion ol the Orator
by his pupil hleyer (1827). ln this worlt special attention was given ιο
sach evidence as ιο the test as could be derived lrcm the quotations cl
rhetoriciam and grammarians 'lhe apparatus criticus also included a
conspectus ol the text as printed by previous editors, together with a
record ol the readings ol the codex Vitebergensir, Dresdenst's and Mona·

aod the roas &ephori 'lhe two last ol these, which were much inter·
polated, led him ιο lorrn a very unlavourable opinion ol the muttit&
aad this opinion received the sanction ol Orelli in his special edition ol
the Orator with the Brutus and Topica (rbgol‘, which nas mainly
founded oo the Ethsioileasir and Vrielagenrir, arss which, it will be
ronembered, have since been traccd ιο Poggio's copy ol a us still in

existence. Α collatino ol the codex Erloagotsr's, let at Orelli’s disposal
by Beier, led him ιο distinguish between trro classes ol interpolatione in

the aanlr', coe belonging to the middle ages, aad another which he
moed tothe fourth or lilth century‘.
