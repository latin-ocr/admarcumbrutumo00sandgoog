redundancy of the Asiatic orators to their comparative unfamiliarity

Ι judgmeot, the difference of style is more satisfactorily accuuoted for by
Ι the differenoe of taste which distinguished the Asiatic orators and their
'audieraees from those of Athens'. Cicero himself insists on tracing it
ιο the influence of the audieoce, the less cultivated ear of the Carian,
Phrygian, or lllysian, tolerating what nottld never have been endured by
tlte higher relinement of the Athenian (3 25). But even this explanation
is not completely adequate, for the same faults of style are to be found
in the rhetorical historiam of that age, in nriters who, in their origin
and in their places of educatioo, though oot in the subsequent scenes
of their literary labours, nere as far removed from one another, aod
from Asia, as Callisthenes of Stageirus and Timaeus of Tauromenium.
