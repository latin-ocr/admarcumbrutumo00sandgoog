m THE amc ORATORS.

phantly ansvesed by the temous oration on the cmm Aeschines
viuum frosm Athens, and tied in the first place to Ephesus to arrait
Aluander’s return frons his conquests in the east, in the hope oi being
restored by him to his native country, but, on hearing ol his death, he
retired ιο Rhodes and there set up a school, which is sometimes de·
nmen as a school oi rhetoric'. To this tirne oi his lile belongs the
cumred story srhich, in illustratiou oi the importance oi delivery, is
tsld as follows in the le oratore (iii 213): ‘cum propter ignominiam
inid oesn'sset Athenis et se Rhodum contulisset, rogatus a Rhodiis
legisse fertur orationem illam egregiam, quam in Ctesiphontem contra
ommonem dixerat; qua perlecta petitum ab eo est postridie, ut
legeret illato etiam, quae erat contra ab Demosthene pro Ctesiphonte
alita: quarn cum suavissima et maxima soce legisset, admirantibus
mrbus: Quanto, inquit, magis miraremini, si audissetis ipsum· l’ He
:bsequently removed to Samos, and died soon alter, in 3¹4
As regards his style it is northy ol note, that rehile Aeschines
rqsntedly resen to the artificisl diction, the studied antitheses, and,
abore all, the rhetorical slrill oi Demosthenes', the latter constently
tubes the oratoricsl success oi his opponent ιο his great natural ,
putrere, and to his strong and clear and carelully cultivated voice⁴. In
murrast to the passionate gesticulations which Aeschines criticises in
lr's rival, his own delivery appears to have been more solemn andl
rrately'. A well-known statue, found in the theatro ol Herculaneum,
represents him in a dignitied attitude, not without a certain robustness
el physique, as compared with the attenuated lrame ol Demosthenes,
and rritb an air ol settsatistaction in his countenance, his tett ann
tum behind his baclr where it is completely enveloped in the iolds
cd his ample robe, and his right arm similarly enlolded on his chest
siu tbe hand alone visible'.

In the absolutely indispensable qualities oi correctness, cleamess,¹
ssd tesseness ol expression, he is distinctly interior to Demosthenes;
lut, asa set-oti to these deiecta, he has many merits ol a less essential
eder: aoertar'n pomp and splendour ol vocabulary (i tro), sometimes>¹
