lei THE ORATOR OF CICERO.

grrlar capacity for conoentrating himself in the midst of distractions-

with eaeo, he was sn admirer of Demosthenes, whose speeches he

devoted adherent of the Stoicohcademic School whose reaching he
had studied under Aristus and Antiochus, and rras himself an author
ol philosophical works in latin (Acad. i ιι), which, in the judgment of
Quintilian, who regarded them as superior to his speeches, bore the
stamp of a genuine sincerity (rr r ll ιη), and one of which, the de
limate, vrrs dedicated to Cicero himself ⁴. Such was the man whose
mare Cicero had already given to the dialogus dr Clorr'r Oratoribus

also that earlier volume of short essays in which he had endeavoured

Cicero'r ostensible reason lor composing the Orator was to meet
the wishes of Brutus, who had repeatedly written to him from Cisalpine
Gaul, in connexion doubtless with the conflicting questions of oratorical
and literary taste which, as we have seen, were about this time keenly
debated in Rome⁸, to ask him what, in Cicero’s own opinion, was
the highest and most perfect type ol eloquence. On the shoulders
ol Brutus, Cicero repeatedly throws the responsilrility of having
prompted him to the work (fl r, 3, 35, 52, 140, 147, 174, 238); anri
orte of the many passages in which he ‹loes so, is deserving of special
notice ln his apprehension as to the way in which Caesar would
regard his recent eulogy of Cato, he is anxious to interpose between
himself and Caesar one who, to the latter, is presumably a persona

grato. He therefore seizes the opportunity which now presente itself

which Brutus was discharging his duties as administrator of Cisalpine
