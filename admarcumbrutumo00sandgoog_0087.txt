Bet itis not only in tlre 11111111 directly bearing on the Atticists
(aa-32) that s polemical purpose ismnniiest. lt is also clearly ap
pereni in tlte long excessus on euphony(r48-r⁶2), and rhythm (161-
²³⁶)- The mistory apologias rritlr which these subjecta are introduced
(rso-rad), plainly rereal Cicero's sensitireness to contemporary criti·
ein in tlris particular, and the seryuel malres it still more evident.
'l‘lre tritior rrlroro he has in rien are doubtless to be r'ound among the
Attidsts d tlte time whose rrhole position implied a protest against the
ehhorately perindie stntctme and the esceelingly rhythmica! character
d his style. 'l'o serere and rigid Atticists lilre the imitatori ol Lysias.
tlte salness and ricimero ot' Cicero necessarily appeared turpirl and
humbertic5 and although he nas himself in theory a devoted admirer oi
, tlte nuic orators and ol' Demosthenes in particular, in practice he
dcrnned sufficientiy iar lrorn that standard to give sorne colour to the
,irnpumion that he nas really an Asiatic orator in ‹lisguisa Our
mats ot' these opponents oi the great Roman stylist come in part
lrorn seriters ola later generation. Quintilian, in his reverence ior
euro, mturally regards such opposition as almost an act oi profanity‚
ud derrounm the Atticists as an impleus gang ol conspirators.
From Cicero's devoted admirer ree leam thot his critica actually
‘dated to denounce irim as unduly turgid and llsiatic and redundant5
ss too much given 1ο reynerum, snd sometimes insipid in his nitticisrns;
. ssd as leeble, diffuse and eren effeminate in his composition''. Α
