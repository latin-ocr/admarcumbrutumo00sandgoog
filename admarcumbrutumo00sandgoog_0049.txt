αἱ style ιιιιιάι more indebted to Isocrates, to rrhose points of excellence
he has, as s stylist, though not as an orator or as s politician,a far
doner affinity⁸. When he had clothed in a Greek dress the story of
hisoen consulship, herrrote to his friend confessing that he had ‘lavished
αι its toilet tlte srhole of the frsgrant curket of Isocrates and all the
htle perfomeboxes of his pupils, besides giving its touch of the rhetori·
cal rouge of Aristotle’'. And the same sels-criticism may be applied,
vith almost equal justice, to his oren oratorical prose We may readily
4 recognise io the oum the importunes which he justly attaches to his
i mutant endeavour to mould the Latin language into a more effective
irtstrument for Roman oratory. ln that endeavour, there were two
1 points on which he set special store, the proper application of oratorical
lrhythrn, and the due development of the oratorical period. ln both
of these points, his true prototype in Greek literature is undoubtedly
Isocrates, and tlris is the reason rrhy he dwetls with such emphasis on
the services of his Greek precursor towards thc perfecting of these ινφ
importantelements of artistic prose. It was by elaborating the rhythm
of prose and the structure of the period, that Isocrates, following in the
footsteps of 'lhtasymachus succeeded in forming a normal style rrhich
ns admirably adaptcd for some of the higher kinds of prose compo

rhetorioel type, left no room for any further development'.
