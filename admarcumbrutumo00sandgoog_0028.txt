lN'l'RODUCTlON.

Or the rhetorical worlrs of Cicero, tlte most importent are the
Oratore, the Brutus aud the Orafon In tlte lest oi these, his ru
purpose is to portray the ideal oraton In oarrying out this purpose,
keeps steadily before his view the Greek modeis of eloquenoe andt
Greek authorities on rhetoric, but lte is st the sante time conanus
conscious of his own distinguished career es sn orator, end of hiso
relations to contemporary criticism. For su adequue unumuad
of the Orator, it is therefore neoemary for us to haue some tuomet
of the previous history of oratory and rhetoric, not only from the carli
times to the death of Demosthenes, but also during those days of decli
which witnessed, in the Greek world, the rise of the struggle betwe
Atticism and Asianism; astruggle which had its counterpart in Ror
during the life of Cicero, and was not brought to a decisive conclusi
till the time of Augustus It will also be necessary for us to taire t
count of Cicero's own rhetorical training, and briefly to review those
his rhetorical writings which are most closely connected with the Oret

The oratory and rhetoric of Greece and Rome, with the numere
points of historical, philosophieal, literary and critical interest then
involved, have been the theme not only of a multitude of special mor
graphs, but also of elaborate and comprehensive works by some of t
ablcst scholars both at home and abroad. For the present purpose,
will be sufficient to notice, in the following introductory pag·
the points which appear to be best calculated to throrr light on t
Orator of Cicero. Instead of traversing too wide a field by s surrey
all the ancient authorities, we shall therefore concontrate our attenti
mainly, but by no means exclusively, on those passages in tlte rhetoris
works of Cicero which supply us with his own retrospect of the histo
of oratory and rhetoric, and his own criticisms on those who, whether
rhetoricians or as orators, had preceded him either in the theoretir
exposition or in the practieal applicetion of the art in which he rr
himself so consummate a master.
